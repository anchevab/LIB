# Seeed grove w600 UART wifi[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_w600.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_w600)

## Introduction
This library is intended to control the w600 wifi module from Arduino via AT commands. I have substantially re-written the original grove code to reduce dynamic memory allocation (particularly the use of String objects). 

#### Core functionality:
   - genderic function to send AT commands (sendAT)
   - helper functions built on top of this to enable connecting the module to a wifi access point and posing data via http. 

The Air602 is a 2.4G Wi-Fi module based on the embedded Wi-Fi SoC chip (W600) with a  12-pin Stamp Hole Expansion Interface. 

The air602 UART wifi module receive AT command,So arduino board can control it via UART port.  

## Notice
* Since atmega328(like arduino UNO) has only one serial port,The library use hardware serial port to output log info,and control the Air602 via softserial(2,3)ï¼ŒSo the grove cable should attach to (D2,D3) port.  

* When using the samd board(like arduino zero,seeeduino cortex M0+),the SerialUSB for printing log info.The Serial(defined in library)for send AT command.  

* By default, The arduino board outputs the instruction info while sending AT command to air602 wifi module,user can close it in file:ATSerial.h,change the DEBUG_EN from 1 to 0.


* The sta_http_get_lcd_display example does not support arduino UNO(Actually all boards which based on atmega328) since it only  has a small serial buffer.
